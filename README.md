Katamaran
=========

Katamaran is a verification framework for instruction set architectures in the
Coq proof assistant. It provides the deeply-embedded language Î¼Sail, a variant
of the [Sail](https://github.com/rems-project/sail) language, for the
specification of instructions sets and provides furthermore facilities for the
specification of separation logic-based contracts and for semi-automatically
verifying these contracts. The goal is to formally specify and verify with
machine-checked proofs critical security guarantees of instruction sets. For
more information visit [our website](https://katamaran-project.github.io/).

Dependencies
------------

The development version of Katamaran has the following lower bounds:
```
coq            >= 8.16
coq-equations  >= 1.3
coq-iris       >= 4.0
coq-stdpp      >= 1.8
```
and has also been tested with coq 8.17.

An easy way to setup your system is to create a fresh opam switch, pin the Coq and Iris versions and install equations (stdpp will be installed as a dependency of Iris):
```
opam switch create katamaran ocaml-base-compiler.5.0.0
opam pin add coq 8.16.1
opam pin add coq-iris 4.0.0
opam install coq-equations
```

Installation
------------

### Via opam (dev version)
Add our opam repository and install the latest development version from Github
with the following commands:
```
opam repo add katamaran https://github.com/katamaran-project/opam-repository.git
opam install coq-katamaran
```

### From github
```
git clone https://github.com/katamaran-project/katamaran.git
cd katamaran && make && make install
```

Using
-----

The basic usage structure of Katamaran is described in the [USING.md](USING.md) file.
The easiest and recommended way to use the library for new developments is to adapt one of our existing case studies, for example the [MinimalCaps](case_study/MinimalCaps) machine.
Some more information about the internal structure of the library is provided in the [HACKING.md](HACKING.md) file.
