# Case Study: RISC-V with PMP 
Case study for (base) RISC-V with Physical Memory Protection (PMP).

## Source

This machine is based on a minimal model of the official RISC-V Sail model.
The corresponding model can be found at [https://gitlab.soft.vub.ac.be/shuygheb/sail-minimal-riscv](sail-minimal-riscv).

The machine that this case study represents is based on the official RISC-V code, more specifically, (parts of) the following files:
- [https://github.com/rems-project/sail-riscv/blob/master/model/riscv_insts_base.sail](Base Instructions)
- [https://github.com/rems-project/sail-riscv/blob/master/model/riscv_pmp_regs.sail](PMP Configuration)
- [https://github.com/rems-project/sail-riscv/blob/master/model/riscv_pmp_control.sail](PMP)
