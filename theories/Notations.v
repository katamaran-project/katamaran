(* Really short summary on notations in Coq:
   - Coq uses precedence levels from 0 to 100.
   - Lower levels bound tighter than higher levels.
   - A /\ B is at level 80, right assoc
   - A \/ B is at level 85, right assoc
   - x = y is at level 70

(* We use the character ↦ as an infix notation for points-to predicates in the
   case-studies. This should bind tighter than ∗ which is at level 80. Hence
   x in this notation has to bind at least tighter than that. Also it should
   allow for x being a typed binding (y ∷ t) which is at level 49, so looser
   than that. *)
