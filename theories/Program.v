  (* We use callgraphs of Sail programs to define a very coarse termination
     metric on functions, e.g. all non-recursive functions or said differently
     all functions not on a loop in the call graph are terminating. This is used
     for reasoning about programs with the total weakest preconditions.

     The call graph however represents terminating and non-terminating
     functions. Terminating functions are then singled out using an
     accessibility predicate. *)
  Module Import callgraph.

    (* Each function is a node in the call graph. Note that functions
       parameterized at the meta-level are different nodes, i.e. one node
       for each possible instantiation of the meta-parameters. Call graphs
       are representation using an association lists per node.

       To instantiate the [Program] module the user has to provide a standalone
       definition of a call graph, i.e. that is a priori not linked to the
       function definitions. We then also ask the user to provide a proof
       that the two are consistent (well-formed). This setup ensures that we
       can support all of the source language features, including [stm_bind], in
       case we ever need it.

       The user provided call graph is not enforced to be precise, i.e. the
       adjacency list for a node may contain more functions than are called in
       reality. This is a sound overapproximation. Or in other words, the
       adjacency list defines an upper bound of functions that may be called. *)

       for polymorphic functions. Instead we allow duplicates, of which there
